`arredemo-custom-test` amazingly shows a slider of heroic images.

# Unpublished

This super _fooy_ package is not published onto NPM. 

So `arredemo` should fallback to the local `README.md` (the one you are reading)
in order to build the *Docs* page.

# External dependencies

Current package will basically make use of the external `react-touch-drag-slider`.

`arredemo` will bundle it with no problem and correctly build the *Demo* page,

# How to run

As any other test within `arredemo`:

```
  npx arredemo build
```

And then visit the generated `./arredemo/index.html` with your browser.
